        <h3 style="text-align: center;">How to use ChatGPT for your model</h3><br>
        <p>
            To use ChatGPT better, you have to define what do you need.it's crucial to provide specific details and context about your inquiry. For instance, instead of asking a broad question like "How do I improve my business canvas?" you could ask, "In the 'Customer Segments' section of my business canvas, how can I identify niche market segments for my online pet grooming service targeting urban millennials?" <br>
            By being specific about the section of the canvas you're focusing on and the target market you're addressing, you help me understand the scope of your question and provide a more relevant response. Additionally, including examples or scenarios, such as mentioning specific challenges you're facing or goals you're trying to achieve, can further clarify your question and facilitate a more effective exchange of information.
